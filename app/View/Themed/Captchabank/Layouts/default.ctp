			                        To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. 
									<br /><br />
									<strong>What this means for you:</strong> When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license or other identifying documents.

		APR is a commonly used abbreviation that stands for Annual Percentage Rate. This is a formula computed to show consumers what the interest rate combined with all the fees of a loan will be, in total, when analyzed for an entire year. APR is a way for consumers to compare and shop by knowing what the representative APR ranges might be for a loan that you may receive on this site.
		<br><br> 
		After you are matched with a lender, the lender is required to provide you, the consumer, with all costs associated to be expressed as an annual percentage rate of interest (APR). This information will include the identity of the creditor, the amount financed, the itemization of amount financed, the finance charge, the annual percentage rate, your payment schedule and your total number of payments. You will be able to review all this information BEFORE you obligate yourself to any loan. Your interest rate will vary depending upon which product you select from which lender. In addition, the Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits creditors from discriminating against applicants on the basis of color, race, religion, sex, marital status and age.                      </div>

		                        We are not your lender. This site is a lending matching network that matches you with the best online lenders. Because there are many lenders offering many different products we don't know the product or the exact APR that your lender may offer you. But rest assured, you lender must disclose all this information to you before you obligate yourself to any loan. Generally speaking, there are two major types of products that you may be offered from the lending partners on this site. Those products are installment loans, and short term personal loans. Installment loans tend to be longer in terms and lower in interest rates than your typical short term loans. Usually the typical APR range for installment loans is anywhere from 6.59% up to 39.99% APR for most installment loan products offered through the lending partners on this site. Generally, the typical representative APR range is somewhere between 261% and 1404% for a short term loan that is intended for 14 days. It is important that you review your specific loan terms that you are offered from your lender before you obligate yourself to the terms.

		                        Once you are matched with a lender, you will be given all of your loan terms, in advance and in writing, for you to review. If you accept the terms and conditions of the loan offer, you are agreeing to pay that loan back in the amount of time expressed in the loan documents. If you do not understand anything in the loan agreement, you should not move forward. You should always pay your loan back on time to avoid additional fees and penalties. Partial payment, non-payment, or late payment is likely to result in the following:
		                        <ul>
		                        <li>Associated Fees/Interest rate adjustment - some lenders will charge fees, or adjust your interest rate if you are making late payments.</li>
		                        <li>Collection practices - If you refuse to repay the loan all together, it is likely that the lender will engage a collection company to try and recoup what you owe them (just like any lender would).</li>
		                        <li>Credit Score impact - if you do not repay your loan on time, your delinquency may be reported to a credit bureau, which could negatively impact your credit score.</li>
		                        <li>Renewal policy - As a convenience to you, some lenders may offer a renewed or "roll-over" loan that may have additional fees and may renew automatically, unless you request otherwise. Please make sure to review your lender's renewal policies, and make sure that your payment preferences are known to your lender.</li>
		                        </ul>
		                        This information will be disclosed by each individual lender. Please don't agree to any loan that you cannot repay. If you have questions or need more information on late payment or renewal policies, please contact the lender directly and they will be happy to provide you that information. While most lenders in this site's network do not run a traditional credit check, it is important for us to let you know that in some cases credit checks, consumer credit reports and other personal data may be obtained by some lenders. These checks typically are performed by Experian, Equifax, Trans Union or through alternative providers in order to make a decision on whether or not to offer you a loan. As with any loan, it's important to repay the loan on time or contact the lender to work out a payment plan just as soon as possible.
